# QRMatrix

This is a library to encode binary string data into QR Code, following the ISO 18004. It supports all 4 encoding modes (Numeric, AlphaNumeric, Kanji, Byte); other QR features: ECI protocol, MicroQR, Structured Append, FNC1.

This lib is made in C++, not required any 3rd library.

It's a bit low level. It does not include text processing or drawing features. It takes your binary string data as input, encodes them into a 2D bytes array representing the QR Code symbol. You may have to implement a small drawing process to turn it into an image (please check [the examples](examples.md)).

## Usage

### Source code

For a quick starting, you import the folder [QRMatrix](QRMatrix) into your project.

### Create QR code

You only need to include one header file:

```
#include "QRMatrix/qrmatrixencoder.h"
```

Let's assume we have an UTF-8 C string as input, we will create a QR code with mode Byte and Error Correction level High:

```
const char* inputText = "some text in UTF-8"; // length = 18 bytes
// Create a data segment
QRMatrixSegment segment(EncodingMode::byte, (const UnsignedByte*)inputText, 18);
QRMatrixSegment segments[] = {segment1};
try {
    // Create QR code
    QRMatrixBoard board = QRMatrixEncoder::encode(segments, 1, ErrorCorrectionLevel::high);
    // Drawing QR code
    for (unsigned int row = 0; row < board.dimension(); row += 1) {
        for (unsigned int column = 0; column < board.dimension(); column += 1) {
            UnsignedByte cell = data[row][column];
            UnsignedByte low = cell & BoardCell::lowMask;
            if (low == BoardCell::set) {
                // This is a QR black module
            }
        }
    }
} catch (QRMatrixException error) {
    // Fail to create QR code
}
```

For more detail please check [Detail Manual](DOCS/index.md).

You can find some examples project inside folder [Examples](Examples). The description about those examples is [here](DOCS/examples.md).
